# livestockmap

An interactive map of buildings where livestock is kept in the Netherlands.

## Ideas

### Company information (KvK)
- Search for companies registered at the KvK near a building on the map
- Determine from the registration information what type of livestock is kept (cattle, pigs, chickens, etc).

#### API options
- https://developers.kvk.nl/nl/apis (requires a KvK number)
- https://overheid.io/documentatie/v3/openkvk (may not have the same information as the KvK API, more expensive)
